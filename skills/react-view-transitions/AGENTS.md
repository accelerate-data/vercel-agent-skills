# React View Transitions — Complete Reference

React's View Transition API lets you animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition` under the hood. Declare *what* to animate with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger *when* with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, and control *how* with CSS classes or the Web Animations API. Unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

## When to Animate (and When Not To)

Every `<ViewTransition>` should answer: **what spatial relationship or continuity does this animation communicate to the user?** If you can't articulate it, don't add it.

### Hierarchy of Animation Intent

From highest value to lowest — start from the top and only move down if your app doesn't already have animations at that level:

| Priority | Pattern | What it communicates | Example |
|----------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Shared element** (`name`) | "This is the same thing — I'm going deeper" | List thumbnail morphs into detail hero |
| 2 | **Suspense reveal** | "Data loaded, here's the real content" | Skeleton cross-fades into loaded page |
| 3 | **List identity** (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement" | Cards reorder during sort/filter |
| 4 | **State change** (`enter`/`exit`) | "Something appeared or disappeared" | Panel slides in on toggle |
| 5 | **Route change** (layout-level) | "Going to a new place" | Cross-fade between pages |

Route-level transitions (#5) are the lowest priority because the URL change already signals a context switch. A blanket cross-fade on every navigation says nothing — it's visual noise. Prefer specific, intentional animations (#1–#4) over ambient page transitions.

**Rule of thumb:** at any given moment, only one level of the tree should be visually transitioning. If your pages already manage their own Suspense reveals or shared element morphs, adding a layout-level route transition on top produces double-animation where both levels fight for attention.

## Availability

- `<ViewTransition>` and `addTransitionType` require `react@canary` or `react@experimental`. Check `react --version` — if these APIs are not available, install canary: `npm install react@canary react-dom@canary`.
- Browser support: Chromium 111+, with Firefox and Safari adding support. The API gracefully degrades — unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

---

## Core Concepts

### The `<ViewTransition>` Component

Wrap the elements you want to animate:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

<ViewTransition>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

React automatically assigns a unique `view-transition-name` to the nearest DOM node inside each `<ViewTransition>`, and calls `document.startViewTransition` behind the scenes. Never call `startViewTransition` yourself — React coordinates all view transitions and will interrupt external ones.

### Animation Triggers

React decides which type of animation to run based on what changed:

| Trigger | When it fires |
|---------|--------------|
| **enter** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first inserted during a Transition |
| **exit** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first removed during a Transition |
| **update** | DOM mutations happen inside a `<ViewTransition>`, or the boundary changes size/position due to an immediate sibling |
| **share** | A named `<ViewTransition>` unmounts and another with the same `name` mounts in the same Transition (shared element transition) |

Only updates wrapped in `startTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or `Suspense` activate `<ViewTransition>`. Regular `setState` updates immediately and does not animate.

### Critical Placement Rule

`<ViewTransition>` only activates enter/exit if it appears **before any DOM nodes** in the component tree:

```jsx
// Works — ViewTransition is before the DOM node
function Item() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
      <div>Content</div>
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

// Broken — a <div> wraps the ViewTransition, preventing enter/exit
function Item() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
        <div>Content</div>
      </ViewTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Styling Animations with View Transition Classes

### Props

Each prop controls a different animation trigger. Values can be:

- `"auto"` — use the browser default cross-fade
- `"none"` — disable this animation type
- `"my-class-name"` — a custom CSS class
- An object `{ [transitionType]: value }` for type-specific animations (see Transition Types below)

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"          // disable everything not explicitly listed
  enter="slide-in"        // CSS class for enter animations
  exit="slide-out"        // CSS class for exit animations
  update="cross-fade"     // CSS class for update animations
  share="morph"           // CSS class for shared element animations
/>
```

If `default` is `"none"`, all triggers are off unless explicitly listed.

### Defining CSS Animations

Use the view transition pseudo-element selectors with the class name:

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-out-to-left;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-in-from-right;
}

@keyframes slide-out-to-left {
  to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes slide-in-from-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
}
```

The pseudo-elements available are:

- `::view-transition-group(.class)` — the container for the transition
- `::view-transition-image-pair(.class)` — contains old and new snapshots
- `::view-transition-old(.class)` — the outgoing snapshot
- `::view-transition-new(.class)` — the incoming snapshot

---

## Transition Types with `addTransitionType`

`addTransitionType` lets you tag a transition with a string label so `<ViewTransition>` can pick different animations based on *what caused* the change. This is essential for directional navigation (forward vs. back) or distinguishing user actions (click vs. swipe vs. keyboard).

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

function navigate(url, direction) {
  startTransition(() => {
    addTransitionType(`navigation-${direction}`); // "navigation-forward" or "navigation-back"
    setCurrentPage(url);
  });
}
```

You can add multiple types to a single transition, and if multiple transitions are batched, all types are collected.

### Using Types with View Transition Classes

Pass an object instead of a string to any activation prop. Keys are transition type strings, values are CSS class names:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'fade-in',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'fade-out',
  }}
>
  <Page />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `default` key inside the object is the fallback when no type matches. If any type has the value `"none"`, the ViewTransition is disabled for that trigger.

### Using Types with CSS `:active-view-transition-type()`

React also adds all transition types as browser view transition types, enabling pure CSS scoping:

```css
:root:active-view-transition-type(navigation-forward) {
  &::view-transition-old(*) {
    animation: 300ms ease-out slide-out-to-left;
  }
  &::view-transition-new(*) {
    animation: 300ms ease-out slide-in-from-right;
  }
}
```

### Using Types with View Transition Events

The `types` array is also available in event callbacks:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  onEnter={(instance, types) => {
    const duration = types.includes('fast') ? 150 : 500;
    const anim = instance.new.animate(
      [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
      { duration, easing: 'ease-out' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
>
```

---

## Shared Element Transitions

Assign the same `name` to two `<ViewTransition>` components — one in the unmounting tree and one in the mounting tree — to animate between them as if they're the same element:

```jsx
const HERO_IMAGE = 'hero-image';

function ListView({ onSelect }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/thumb.jpg" onClick={() => startTransition(() => onSelect())} />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

function DetailView() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/full.jpg" />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

Rules for shared element transitions:
- Only one `<ViewTransition>` with a given `name` can be mounted at a time — use globally unique names (namespace with a prefix or module constant).
- The "share" trigger takes precedence over "enter"/"exit".
- If either side is outside the viewport, no pair forms and each side animates independently as enter/exit.
- Use a constant defined in a shared module to avoid name collisions:

```jsx
// shared-names.ts
export const HERO_IMAGE = 'hero-image-detail';
```

---

## View Transition Events (JavaScript Animations)

For imperative control, use the `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate`, and `onShare` callbacks:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  onEnter={(instance, types) => {
    const anim = instance.new.animate(
      [{ transform: 'scale(0.8)', opacity: 0 }, { transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 1 }],
      { duration: 300, easing: 'ease-out' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel(); // always return cleanup
  }}
  onExit={(instance, types) => {
    const anim = instance.old.animate(
      [{ transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 1 }, { transform: 'scale(0.8)', opacity: 0 }],
      { duration: 200, easing: 'ease-in' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `instance` object provides:
- `instance.old` — the `::view-transition-old` pseudo-element
- `instance.new` — the `::view-transition-new` pseudo-element
- `instance.group` — the `::view-transition-group` pseudo-element
- `instance.imagePair` — the `::view-transition-image-pair` pseudo-element
- `instance.name` — the `view-transition-name` string

Always return a cleanup function that cancels the animation so the browser can properly handle interruptions.

Only one event fires per `<ViewTransition>` per Transition. `onShare` takes precedence over `onEnter` and `onExit`.

## Common Patterns

### Animate Enter/Exit of a Component

```jsx
import { ViewTransition, useState, startTransition } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => startTransition(() => setShow(s => !s))}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      {show && (
        <ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out">
          <Panel />
        </ViewTransition>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Animate List Reorder

Wrap each item (not a wrapper div) in `<ViewTransition>` with a stable `key`:

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

Triggering the reorder inside `startTransition` will smoothly animate each item to its new position. Avoid wrapper `<div>`s between the list and `<ViewTransition>` — they block the reorder animation.

**How it works:** `startTransition` doesn't need async work to animate. The View Transition API captures a "before" snapshot of the DOM, then React applies the state update, and the API captures an "after" snapshot. As long as items change position between snapshots, the animation runs — even for purely synchronous local state changes like sorting.

### Force Re-Enter with `key`

Use a `key` prop on `<ViewTransition>` to force an enter/exit animation when a value changes — even if the component itself doesn't unmount:

```jsx
<ViewTransition key={searchParams.toString()} enter="slide-up" exit="slide-down" default="none">
  <ResultsGrid results={results} />
</ViewTransition>
```

When the key changes, React unmounts and remounts the `<ViewTransition>`, which triggers exit on the old instance and enter on the new one. This is useful for animating content swaps driven by URL parameters, tab switches, or any state change where the content identity changes but the component type stays the same.

### Animate Suspense Fallback to Content

Wrap `<Suspense>` in `<ViewTransition>` to cross-fade from fallback to loaded content:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
    <AsyncContent />
  </Suspense>
</ViewTransition>
```

For directional motion, give the fallback and content separate `<ViewTransition>`s with explicit triggers. Use `default="none"` on the content one to prevent it from re-animating on unrelated transitions:

```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <AsyncContent />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

### Opt Out of Nested Animations

Wrap children in `<ViewTransition update="none">` to prevent them from animating when a parent changes:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <div className={theme}>
    <ViewTransition update="none">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

For more patterns (isolate floating elements, reusable animated collapse, preserve state with `<Activity>`, exclude elements with `useOptimistic`), see Appendix: Patterns and Guidelines below.

---

## How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact

When a transition fires, **every** `<ViewTransition>` in the tree that matches the trigger participates simultaneously. Each gets its own `view-transition-name`, and the browser animates all of them inside a single `document.startViewTransition` call. They run in parallel, not sequentially.

This means a layout-level `<ViewTransition>` (whole-page cross-fade) + a page-level one (Suspense slide-up) + per-item ones (list reorder) all fire at once. The result is usually competing animations that look broken.

### Use `default="none"` Liberally

Prevent unintended animations by disabling the default trigger on ViewTransitions that should only fire for specific types:

```jsx
// Only animates when 'navigation-forward' or 'navigation-back' types are present.
// Silent on all other transitions (Suspense reveals, state changes, etc.)
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

**TypeScript note:** When passing an object to `enter`/`exit`, the `ViewTransitionClassPerType` type requires a `default` key. Always include `default: 'none'` (or `'auto'`) in the object — omitting it causes a type error even if the component-level `default` prop is set.

Without `default="none"`, a `<ViewTransition>` with `default="auto"` (the implicit default) fires the browser's cross-fade on **every** transition — including ones triggered by child Suspense boundaries, `useDeferredValue` updates, or `startTransition` calls within the page.

### Choosing One Level

Pick the level that carries the most meaning for your app:

- **App with per-page Suspense reveals and shared elements:** Don't add a layout-level `<ViewTransition>` on `{children}`. The pages already manage their own transitions. A layout-level cross-fade on top will double-animate.
- **Simple app with no per-page animations:** A layout-level `<ViewTransition>` with `default="auto"` on `{children}` gives you free cross-fades between routes.
- **Mixed:** Use `default="none"` at the layout level and only activate it for specific `transitionTypes` (e.g., directional navigation). This way it stays silent during per-page Suspense transitions.

The exception is **shared element transitions** — these intentionally span levels (one side unmounts while the other mounts) and don't conflict with other VTs because the `share` trigger takes precedence over `enter`/`exit`.

---

## Next.js Integration

Next.js supports React View Transitions. `<ViewTransition>` works out of the box for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — no config needed.

To also animate `<Link>` navigations, enable the experimental flag in `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`):

```js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**What this flag does:** It wraps every `<Link>` navigation in `document.startViewTransition`, so all mounted `<ViewTransition>` components participate in every link click. Without this flag, only `startTransition`/`Suspense`-triggered transitions animate. This makes the composition rules in "How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact" especially important: use `default="none"` on layout-level `<ViewTransition>`s to avoid competing animations.

For a detailed guide including App Router patterns and Server Component considerations, see Appendix: Next.js Integration Guide below.

Key points:
- The `<ViewTransition>` component is imported from `react` directly — no Next.js-specific import.
- Works with the App Router and `startTransition` + `router.push()` for programmatic navigation.

### The `transitionTypes` prop on `next/link`

`next/link` supports a native `transitionTypes` prop that eliminates the need for custom `TransitionLink` wrapper components. Instead of intercepting navigation with `onNavigate`, `startTransition`, and `addTransitionType`, you pass transition types directly:

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

// Before (manual wrapper required):
<TransitionLink href="/products/1" type="transition-to-detail">
  View Product
</TransitionLink>

// After (native prop, no wrapper needed):
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>
  View Product
</Link>
```

The `transitionTypes` prop accepts an array of strings — the same types you would pass to `addTransitionType`. This removes the need for `'use client'`, `useRouter`, and custom link components when all you need is to tag a navigation with a transition type.

For full examples with shared element transitions and directional animations, see Appendix: Next.js Integration Guide below.

## Real-World Patterns

For complete real-world patterns (searchable grids, card expand/collapse, type-safe transition helpers, shared elements across routes), see Appendix: Patterns and Guidelines below.

---

## Accessibility

Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. React does not disable animations automatically for this preference. Add this to your global CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

Or disable specific animations conditionally in JavaScript events by checking the media query.

---

## Troubleshooting

**ViewTransition not activating:**
- Ensure the `<ViewTransition>` comes before any DOM node in the component (not wrapped in a `<div>`).
- Ensure the state update is inside `startTransition`, not a plain `setState`.

**"Two ViewTransition components with the same name" error:**
- Each `name` must be globally unique across the entire app at any point in time. Add item IDs: `name={\`hero-${item.id}\`}`.

**Back button skips animation:**
- The legacy `popstate` event requires synchronous completion, conflicting with view transitions. Upgrade your router to use the Navigation API for back-button animations.

**Animations from `flushSync` are skipped:**
- `flushSync` completes synchronously, which prevents view transitions from running. Use `startTransition` instead.

**Enter/exit not firing in a client component (only updates animate):**
- `startTransition(() => setState(...))` triggers a Transition, but if the new content isn't behind a `<Suspense>` boundary, React treats the swap as an **update** to the existing tree — not an enter/exit. The `<ViewTransition>` sees its children change but never fully unmounts/remounts, so only `update` animations fire. To get true enter/exit, either conditionally render the `<ViewTransition>` itself (so it mounts/unmounts with the content), or wrap the async content in `<Suspense>` so React can treat the reveal as an insertion.

**Competing / double animations on navigation:**
- Multiple `<ViewTransition>` components at different tree levels (layout + page + items) all fire simultaneously inside a single `document.startViewTransition`. If a layout-level one cross-fades the whole page while a page-level one slides up content, both run at once and fight for attention. Fix: use `default="none"` on the layout-level `<ViewTransition>`, or remove it entirely if pages manage their own animations. See "How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact" above.

**List reorder not animating with `useOptimistic`:**
- If the optimistic value drives the list sort order, items are already in their final positions before the transition snapshot — there's nothing to animate. Use the optimistic value only for controls (labels, icons) and the committed state (`useState`) for the list sort order.

**TypeScript error: "Property 'default' is missing in type 'ViewTransitionClassPerType'":**
- When passing an object to `enter`/`exit`/`update`/`share`, TypeScript requires a `default` key in the object. This applies even if the component-level `default` prop is set. Always include `default: 'none'` (or `'auto'`) in type-keyed objects.

**Batching:**
- If multiple updates occur while an animation is running, React batches them into one. For example: if you navigate A→B, then B→C, then C→D during the first animation, the next animation will go B→D.

## Appendix: Patterns and Guidelines

## Searchable Grid with `useDeferredValue`

A client-side searchable grid where the filtered results cross-fade as the user types. `useDeferredValue` makes the filter update a transition, which activates the wrapping `<ViewTransition>`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useDeferredValue, useState, ViewTransition, Suspense } from 'react';

export default function SearchableGrid({ itemsPromise }) {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.currentTarget.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <ViewTransition>
        <Suspense fallback={<GridSkeleton />}>
          <ItemGrid itemsPromise={itemsPromise} search={deferredSearch} />
        </Suspense>
      </ViewTransition>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Card Expand/Collapse with `startTransition`

Toggle between a card grid and a detail view using `startTransition` to animate the swap. Add a shared element `name` to morph the card into the detail view:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState, useRef, startTransition, ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function ItemGrid({ items }) {
  const [expandedId, setExpandedId] = useState(null);
  const scrollRef = useRef(0);

  return expandedId ? (
    <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" name={`item-${expandedId}`}>
      <ItemDetail
        item={items.find(i => i.id === expandedId)}
        onClose={() => {
          startTransition(() => {
            setExpandedId(null);
            setTimeout(() => window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth', top: scrollRef.current }), 100);
          });
        }}
      />
    </ViewTransition>
  ) : (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {items.map(item => (
        <ViewTransition key={item.id} name={`item-${item.id}`}>
          <ItemCard
            item={item}
            onSelect={() => {
              scrollRef.current = window.scrollY;
              startTransition(() => setExpandedId(item.id));
            }}
          />
        </ViewTransition>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The shared `name={`item-${id}`}` on both the card and detail `<ViewTransition>` creates a shared element pair — the card morphs into the detail view. The `scrollRef` saves and restores scroll position so users return to where they were in the grid. See Appendix: CSS Animation Recipes for the slide-up/slide-down CSS.

## Type-Safe Transition Helpers

For larger apps, define type-safe transition IDs and transition maps to prevent ID clashes and keep animation configurations consistent. Use `as const` arrays for transition IDs, types, and animation classes, then derive types from them:

```tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

const transitionTypes = ['default', 'transition-to-detail', 'transition-to-list', 'transition-backwards', 'transition-forwards'] as const;
const animationTypes = ['auto', 'none', 'animate-slide-from-left', 'animate-slide-from-right', 'animate-slide-to-left', 'animate-slide-to-right'] as const;

type TransitionType = (typeof transitionTypes)[number];
type AnimationType = (typeof animationTypes)[number];
type TransitionMap = { default: AnimationType } & Partial<Record<Exclude<TransitionType, 'default'>, AnimationType>>;

export function HorizontalTransition({ children, enter, exit }: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  enter: TransitionMap;
  exit: TransitionMap;
}) {
  return <ViewTransition enter={enter} exit={exit}>{children}</ViewTransition>;
}
```

These wrappers enforce that only valid transition IDs and animation classes are used, catching mistakes at compile time.

## Shared Elements Across Routes in Next.js

See Appendix: Next.js Integration Guide (Shared Elements Across Routes) for complete examples using `transitionTypes` on `next/link` combined with shared element `<ViewTransition name={...}>` for list-to-detail image morph animations.

## Isolate Floating Elements from Parent Animations

Popovers, tooltips, and dropdowns can get captured in a parent's view transition snapshot, causing them to ghost or animate unexpectedly. Give them their own `viewTransitionName` to isolate them into a separate transition group:

```jsx
<SelectPopover style={{ viewTransitionName: 'popover' }}>
  {options}
</SelectPopover>
```

```css
::view-transition-group(popover) {
  z-index: 100;
}
```

This creates an independent transition group that renders above other transitioning elements. The element won't be included in its parent's old/new snapshot.

For a global fix that ensures all view transition groups render above normal content, use the wildcard selector:

```css
::view-transition-group(*) {
  z-index: 100;
}
```

## Reusable Animated Collapse

For apps with many expand/collapse interactions, extract a reusable wrapper instead of repeating the conditional-render-with-`<ViewTransition>` pattern:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

function AnimatedCollapse({ open, children }) {
  if (!open) return null;
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="expand-in" exit="collapse-out">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

Use it with `startTransition` on the toggle:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => startTransition(() => setOpen(o => !o))}>Toggle</button>
<AnimatedCollapse open={open}>
  <SectionContent />
</AnimatedCollapse>
```

## Preserve State with Activity

Use `<Activity>` with `<ViewTransition>` to animate show/hide while preserving component state:

```jsx
import { Activity, ViewTransition, startTransition } from 'react';

<Activity mode={isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
  <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" exit="slide-out">
    <Sidebar />
  </ViewTransition>
</Activity>
```

## Exclude Elements from a Transition with `useOptimistic`

When a `startTransition` changes both a control (e.g. a button label) and content (e.g. list order), use `useOptimistic` for the control. The optimistic value updates before React's transition snapshot, so it won't animate. The committed state drives the content, which changes within the transition and animates:

```tsx
const [sort, setSort] = useState('newest');
const [optimisticSort, setOptimisticSort] = useOptimistic(sort);

function cycleSort() {
  const nextSort = getNextSort(optimisticSort);
  startTransition(() => {
    setOptimisticSort(nextSort);  // updates before snapshot — no animation
    setSort(nextSort);            // changes within transition — animates
  });
}

// Button uses optimisticSort (instant, excluded from animation)
<button>Sort: {LABELS[optimisticSort]}</button>

// List uses committed sort (changes between snapshots, animates)
{items.sort(comparators[sort]).map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

`useOptimistic` values resolve before the transition snapshot. Any DOM driven by optimistic state is already in its final form when the "before" snapshot is taken, so it doesn't participate in the `<ViewTransition>`. Only DOM driven by committed state (via `setState`) changes between snapshots and animates.

## Animation Timing Guidelines

Match duration to the interaction type — direct user actions need fast feedback, while ambient reveals can be slower:

| Interaction | Duration | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Direct toggle (expand/collapse, show/hide) | 100–200ms | Responds to a click — must feel instant |
| Route transition (directional slide) | 150–250ms | Brief spatial cue, shouldn't delay navigation |
| Suspense reveal (skeleton → content) | 200–400ms | Soft reveal, content is "arriving" |
| Shared element morph | 300–500ms | Users watch the morph — give it room to breathe |

These are starting points. Test on low-end devices — animations that feel smooth on a fast machine can feel sluggish on mobile.

## Appendix: CSS Animation Recipes

Ready-to-use CSS snippets for common view transition animations. Use these class names with `<ViewTransition>` props.

---

## Timing Variables

Define timing as CSS custom properties so durations are adjustable in one place. Use staggered timing — the enter animation delays by the exit duration so the old content leaves before the new content appears:

```css
:root {
  --duration-exit: 150ms;
  --duration-enter: 210ms;
  --duration-move: 400ms;
}
```

All recipes below reference these variables.

### Shared Keyframes

These reusable keyframes are used across multiple recipes:

```css
@keyframes fade {
  from { filter: blur(3px); opacity: 0; }
  to { filter: blur(0); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { translate: var(--slide-offset); }
  to { translate: 0; }
}

@keyframes slide-y {
  from { transform: translateY(var(--slide-y-offset, 10px)); }
  to { transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

The `slide` keyframe uses a CSS variable for direction — set `--slide-offset: -60px` for left, `60px` for right. The same keyframe with `animation-direction: reverse` handles the exit.

---

## Fade

```css
::view-transition-old(.fade-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in fade reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.fade-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade;
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out" />
```

---

## Slide (Vertical)

Slide down on exit, slide up on enter — the most common pattern for Suspense fallback-to-content transitions. Uses staggered timing with a fade:

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-down) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both slide-y reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-up) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-in var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in both slide-y;
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <Content />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

---

## Directional Navigation

A single CSS class name targets both `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` with different animations. This keeps the JSX simple — `enter="nav-forward"` / `exit="nav-forward"`:

```css
::view-transition-old(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}

::view-transition-old(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
```

Usage with transition types:
```jsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'nav-forward': 'nav-forward',
    'nav-back': 'nav-back',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'nav-forward': 'nav-forward',
    'nav-back': 'nav-back',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

Triggering with `transitionTypes` on `next/link`:
```jsx
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['nav-forward']}>Next</Link>
<Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['nav-back']}>Back</Link>
```

Or programmatically:
```jsx
startTransition(() => {
  addTransitionType('nav-forward');
  router.push('/next-page');
});
```

---

## Shared Element Morph

For shared element transitions, control the morph duration on `::view-transition-group` and add a motion blur on `::view-transition-image-pair` to smooth fast-moving elements:

```css
::view-transition-group(.morph) {
  animation-duration: var(--duration-move);
}

::view-transition-image-pair(.morph) {
  animation-name: via-blur;
}

@keyframes via-blur {
  30% { filter: blur(3px); }
}
```

The blur at 30% creates a subtle motion-blur effect — fast-moving elements can be visually jarring, and this smooths the transition without adding perceptible delay.

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition name={`product-${id}`} share="morph">
  <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} />
</ViewTransition>
```

---

## Scale

```css
::view-transition-old(.scale-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in scale-down;
}
::view-transition-new(.scale-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both scale-up;
}

@keyframes scale-down {
  from { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  to { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes scale-up {
  from { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition enter="scale-in" exit="scale-out" />
```

---

## Reduced Motion

Always include this in your global stylesheet to respect user preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

## Appendix: Next.js Integration Guide

## Setup

`<ViewTransition>` works in Next.js out of the box for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — no config flag is needed for those.

To also animate `<Link>` navigations, enable the experimental flag in `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`):

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**What this flag does at runtime:** It wraps every `<Link>` navigation in `document.startViewTransition`. This means all mounted `<ViewTransition>` components in the tree participate in every link navigation — not just transitions triggered by `startTransition` or `Suspense`.

Implications:
- Any `<ViewTransition>` with `default="auto"` (the implicit default) fires the browser's cross-fade on **every** `<Link>` navigation.
- Combined with per-page `<ViewTransition>` components (Suspense reveals, item animations), this produces competing animations.
- Without this flag, `<ViewTransition>` still works for all `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — only `<Link>` navigations won't participate.

The `<ViewTransition>` component is currently available in `react@canary` and `react@experimental` only:

```bash
npm install react@canary react-dom@canary
```

---

## Basic Route Transitions

The simplest approach is wrapping your page content in `<ViewTransition>` inside a layout:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <nav>{/* navigation links */}</nav>
        <ViewTransition>
          {children}
        </ViewTransition>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

When users navigate between routes using `<Link>`, Next.js triggers a transition internally. The `<ViewTransition>` wrapping `{children}` detects the content swap and animates it with the default cross-fade.

> **Warning:** This is an either/or choice with per-page animations. If your pages already have their own `<ViewTransition>` components (Suspense reveals, item reorder, shared elements), a layout-level VT on `{children}` produces double-animation — the layout cross-fades the entire old page while the new page's own entrance animations run simultaneously. Both levels get independent `view-transition-name`s, and the browser animates them in parallel, not sequentially.
>
> Use this pattern only in apps where pages have **no** per-page view transitions. Otherwise, either remove the layout-level VT or set `default="none"` on it.

---

## Layout-Level ViewTransition

For more control, place `<ViewTransition>` at different levels of the layout hierarchy:

```tsx
// app/dashboard/layout.tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function DashboardLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Sidebar />
      <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" exit="fade-out">
        <main>{children}</main>
      </ViewTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Only the `<main>` content animates when navigating between dashboard sub-routes. The sidebar stays static.

> **Caution:** The same composition rule applies here — if the pages rendered inside `{children}` have their own `<ViewTransition>` components (Suspense boundaries, item animations), both levels will fire simultaneously. Use `default="none"` on the layout VT and only activate it for specific `transitionTypes` to avoid conflicts.

---

## The `transitionTypes` Prop on `next/link`

`next/link` supports a native `transitionTypes` prop. This eliminates the need for custom wrapper components that intercept navigation with `onNavigate` + `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()`.

### Before (manual wrapper, requires `'use client'`)

```tsx
'use client';

import { addTransitionType, startTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export function TransitionLink({ type, ...props }: { type: string } & React.ComponentProps<typeof Link>) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <Link
      onNavigate={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType(type);
          router.push(props.href as string);
        });
      }}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

### After (native prop, no wrapper needed, works in Server Components)

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>
  View Product
</Link>
```

The `transitionTypes` prop accepts an array of strings. These types are passed to the View Transition system the same way `addTransitionType` would. `<ViewTransition>` components in the tree respond to these types identically.

This is the recommended approach for link-based navigation transitions. Reserve manual `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` for programmatic navigation (buttons, form submissions, etc.) where `next/link` isn't used.

---

## Programmatic Navigation with Transitions

Use `startTransition` with Next.js's `router.push()` to trigger view transitions from code:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

export function NavigateButton({ href }: { href: string }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType('navigation-forward');
          router.push(href);
        });
      }}
    >
      Go to {href}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Wrapping `router.push()` in `startTransition` is what activates the `<ViewTransition>` boundaries in the tree.

---

## Transition Types for Navigation Direction

A common pattern is to animate differently for forward vs. backward navigation.

### Using `transitionTypes` on `next/link` (preferred)

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

// Forward navigation
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-forwards']}>
  Next →
</Link>

// Backward navigation
<Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['transition-backwards']}>
  ← Back
</Link>
```

### Using `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` (for programmatic navigation)

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

export function NavigateButton({
  href,
  direction = 'forward',
  children,
}: {
  href: string;
  direction?: 'forward' | 'back';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType(`navigation-${direction}`);
          router.push(href);
        });
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Configure `<ViewTransition>` to respond to these types. Use `default="none"` so the layout VT stays silent during per-page Suspense transitions and only fires for explicit navigation types:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ViewTransition
          default="none"
          enter={{
            'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
            'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
            default: 'none',
          }}
          exit={{
            'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
            'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
            default: 'none',
          }}
        >
          {children}
        </ViewTransition>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

---

## Shared Elements Across Routes

Animate a thumbnail expanding into a full image across route transitions. Use `transitionTypes` on the link to tag the navigation direction:

```tsx
// app/products/page.tsx (list page)
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function ProductList({ products }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {products.map((product) => (
        <Link
          key={product.id}
          href={`/products/${product.id}`}
          transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}
        >
          <ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
            <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={400} height={300} />
          </ViewTransition>
          <p>{product.name}</p>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/products/[id]/page.tsx (detail page)
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function ProductDetail({ product }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['transition-to-list']}>
        ← Back to Products
      </Link>
      <ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
        <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={800} height={600} />
      </ViewTransition>
      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Only one `<ViewTransition>` with a given name can be mounted at a time. Since Next.js unmounts the old page and mounts the new page within the same transition, the two `product-${product.id}` boundaries form a shared element pair and the image morphs from its thumbnail size to its full size.

---

## Combining with Suspense and Loading States

Next.js `loading.tsx` files create `<Suspense>` boundaries. Wrap them with `<ViewTransition>` for smooth fallback-to-content reveals:

```tsx
// app/dashboard/layout.tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function DashboardLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Sidebar />
      <ViewTransition>
        <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>
          {children}
        </Suspense>
      </ViewTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The skeleton cross-fades into the actual content once it loads.

> **Important:** If you also have a layout-level `<ViewTransition>` wrapping `{children}` with `default="auto"`, it will fire simultaneously with this Suspense VT on every navigation, producing a double-animation. Either remove the layout-level VT, or set `default="none"` on it so it only responds to explicit `transitionTypes`.

---

## Server Components Considerations

- `<ViewTransition>` can be used in both Server and Client Components — it renders no DOM of its own.
- `<Link>` with `transitionTypes` works in Server Components — no `'use client'` directive needed for link-based transitions.
- `addTransitionType` must be called from a Client Component (inside an event handler with `startTransition`).
- `startTransition` for programmatic navigation must be called from a Client Component.
- Navigation via `<Link>` from `next/link` triggers transitions automatically when the experimental flag is enabled.
- Prefer `transitionTypes` on `<Link>` over custom wrapper components. Only use manual `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()` for non-link interactions (buttons, form submissions, etc.).
